10112024:
- Gnome/Goblin: (actual changes dated from November 7th; forgot to update this file)
	- Merged the projects (under the Goblin name) as the distinction is pretty much unneeded in the end
	- Reworked the entire case to use Cherry MX style switches && heat-set inserts
- Ork:
	- Changed all body holes to use heat-set inserts instead of captive nuts (This change has the goal of removing the need for me to be near the printer so I can print while at work)
- README.md:
	- Updated hardware list for heat-set insert usage

04082024:
- Gnome:
	- Reworked almost the entire top layer geometry
	- Added 2 extra millimeters to the body to better align with the button caps
	- Swapped the board to the next generation (prototype)
	- Added Choc stand-ins and their caps
- Chimera:
	- Changed color to blue to match the filament I'm gonna use (purely aesthetic)
	- WASD plate has been made thicker again

23072024:
- General:
	- Widened holes on Ork and Chimera to accomodate Crown buttons
	- Published STL files
- Chimera:
	- S2P top right panel now has grooves for snap-in buttons
	- Front right only takes two option buttons instead of three to alleviate routing issues

13072024:
- General:
	- Redid the models for the Eurostick and JLF(/JLX/archetypal Japanese lever of the week)
	- Redid the renders for the Ork and Chimera
- Ork:
	- Now has a completely separate 220x220mm Blender file

03072024:
- General:
	- Added an "Acknowledgement" section to the README to give proper recognition to whomever I got inspiration from
- Chimera:
	- Body magnets are now double-stacked to improve adhesion
	- Plate magnets are now exposed (but since the body magnets aren't there is no actual magnet-on-magnet contact,, preventing damage)
	- WASD plate has been reworked to print slightly faster and use slightly less filament

19062024:
- General:
	- Redid all the visuals
- Gnome and Goblin:
	- Adjusted overall thickness to 21mm to allow the buttons to sink in fully into the panel, accounting for cap printing tolerances
- Chimera:
	- Fixed missing geometry on top plates
	- Added a plate for an American lever
	- Made a recess in the bottom left plate just to make sure there won't ever be any clearance issues with any lever
- Or[c|k]:
	- Renamed to Ork for no reason in particular
