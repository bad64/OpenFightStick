# G.N.O.M.E.
## Artwork-friendly Smashbox-style modular case

![For Gnomeregan !](../img/gnome.png)

---

This case is intended for a flat, Smashbox-styled case and custom PCB with Kailh Choc hotswappable switches. Think of it as an alternative to/fork of the Goblin, rather than a separate product entirely.

## Materials needed

- 4 M3 x 8 countersunk screws to attach the bottom plate to the body
- 4 M3 x 8 button-head screws to attach the top plate to the body
- 8 M3 heat-sink inserts
- 5 through hole 6x6 tactile switches (height to taste, I like 12mm)
- A bunch of Kailh Choc switches and corresponding hotswap sockets if you want them to be removable (big fan of Navy switches here)
- A fine instance of a One Board (see PCB folder)
- A laser cut acrylic plate, 3mm thick (TODO: add laser cutting files

## Printing

- Print everything with brims (or mouse ears if your slicer can do them; I have not managed to get the plates to stick with mouse ears alone)
- Body: Tested in PLA, probably would be a cool aesthetic to use carbon fiber for added rigidity
	- Infill is a bit whatever, I use Gyroid with 20%, but whatever floats your boat
- Bottom plate: Tested with PLA and PETG, as long as your filament has good stiffness it should work (this is my way to say "Please don't try TPU or LW-PLA/LW-ASA")
	- 30% zigzag or gyroid infill with anywhere between 3 and 5 top/bottom layers. I recommend slicing the plates face down so they take on your build plate's texture
- Buttons: Honestly anything that *has* infill should work. Recommend PETG over PLA if possible. TPU is kind of an acquired taste in terms of feeling
	- I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5368051) as a base (I don't have a Thingiverse account but I feel credit is due anyway; the author is more than welcome to get in touch if this isn't satisfactory)

Pick your top panel layout, then print one of everything !

## Building

- Add heat-set inserts to the body
- Place PCB inside the body
- (Optional) Add artwork
- Place acrylic panel and screw it in place
- Place caps onto switches (do this **BEFORE** putting them on the PCB, hotswap or not these are tight)
- Place bottom panel and screw it in place

## What's next

- Laser cutting files
- Artwork printing templates
