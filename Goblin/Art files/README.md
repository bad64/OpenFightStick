I think you know the drill. Pick the file corresponding to your layout of choice.

Don't forget to commission a local artist and reward them for your hard work ! Or do it yourself if you're an artist, that also works. Just don't use AI. I can't enforce that but I can still try to get you to consider doing things the Right Way <sup>TM</sup>.

Print at 1:1 scale on A3 paper, preferably border to border since that's the canvas size. Print on poster paper, or failing that, the heaviest paper your print shop carries.

Use an exacto knife or a scalpel with a ruler to *carefully* cut out your art according to instructions. Install and make people wistfully gaze at your Goblin thinking "Damb, maybe I should get one myself".
