## Smashbox style case

![A freshly escaped Snotling](../img/goblin.png)

---

This case is intended for a flat, Smashbox-styled case and custom PCB with Kailh Choc hotswappable switches.

## Materials needed

- 8 M3 x 12 countersunk screws
- 8 M3 heat-sink inserts
- 3 through hole 6x6 tactile switches
- 17 Kailh Choc switches and corresponding hotswap sockets (big fan of Navy switches here)
- About 400 grams of whatever filament you decide to print your body with
- About 15 grams of whatever filament you wanna print the caps with

## Printing

- Print everything with brims (or mouse ears if your slicer can do them; I have not managed to get the plates to stick with mouse ears alone)
- Top & Bottom plates: Tested with PLA and PETG, as long as your filament has good stiffness it should work (this is my way to say "Please don't try TPU or LW-PLA/LW-ASA")
  - 30% grid infill with anywhere between 3 and 5 top/bottom layers. I recommend slicing the plates face down so they take on your build plate's texture
- Buttons: Honestly anything that *has* infill should work. I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5368051) as a base (I don't have a Thingiverse account but I feel credit is due anyway; the author is more than welcome to get in touch if this isn't satisfactory)
	- Use the pliers to squeeze in the pins if they don't fit
- Option button pads: Anything will do, TPU probably feels nice to replicate the membrane buttons of yore

Print every STL file once (except the button cap, you need 17 of it), orientation is already set up.

## Building

- Add heat-set inserts to the bottom parts
- Glue bottom parts together for extra stability (optional)
- Gently layer PCB on top
- Place option button pads
- Place top cover
- Screw on top cover
- Place caps onto switches (do this **BEFORE** putting them on the PCB, hotswap or not these are tight)

## TODO

- Publish the PCB files
- PCB soldering guide ?
