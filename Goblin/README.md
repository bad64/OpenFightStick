## Smashbox style case

![A freshly escaped Snotling](../img/goblin.png)

---

This case is intended for a flat, Smashbox-styled case and custom PCB with Kailh Choc hotswappable switches.

## Materials needed

- 8 M3 x 12 countersunk screws
- 8 M3 heat-sink inserts
- 3 through hole 6x6 tactile switches (height to taste, I like 12mm)
- A lot of Kailh Choc switches and corresponding hotswap sockets if you want them to be removable (big fan of Navy switches here)
- A Raspberry Pi Pico (W should work as well)

## Printing

- Print everything with brims (or mouse ears if your slicer can do them; I have not managed to get the plates to stick with mouse ears alone)
- Top & Bottom plates: Tested with PLA and PETG, as long as your filament has good stiffness it should work (this is my way to say "Please don't try TPU or LW-PLA/LW-ASA")
  - 30% zigzag infill with anywhere between 3 and 5 top/bottom layers. I recommend slicing the plates face down so they take on your build plate's texture
- Buttons: Honestly anything that *has* infill should work. I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5368051) as a base (I don't have a Thingiverse account but I feel credit is due anyway; the author is more than welcome to get in touch if this isn't satisfactory)

Pick your right panel layout, then print 1 of everything (except the bottom, you need two).

## Building

- Add heat-set inserts to the bottom parts
- Glue or solder bottom parts together for extra stability
- Gently layer PCB on top
- Place both halves of top cover
- Screw on top cover
- Place caps onto switches (do this **BEFORE** putting them on the PCB, hotswap or not these are tight)
- Place bottom plates

## TODO

- PCB soldering guide ?
