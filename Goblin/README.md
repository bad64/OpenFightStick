## Smashbox style case

---

This case is intended for a flat, Smashbox-styled case and custom PCB with Kailh Choc hotswappable switches.

## Materials needed

- 8 M3 x 12 countersunk screws
- 8 M3 heat-sink inserts
- 3 through hole 6x6 tactile switches
- 17 Kailh Choc switches and corresponding hotswap sockets (big fan of Navy switches here)
- About 400 grams of whatever filament you decide to print your body with
- About 15 grams of whatever filament you wanna print the caps with

## Printing

- Print everything with brims (or mouse ears if your slicer can do them; I have not managed to get the plates to stick with mouse ears alone)
- Top & Bottom plates: Tested with PLA and PETG, as long as your filament has good stiffness it should work (this is my way to say "Please don't try TPU or LW-PLA/LW-ASA")
  - 30% grid infill with anywhere between 3 and 5 top/bottom layers. I recommend slicing the plates face down so they take on your build plate's texture
- Buttons: Honestly anything that *has* infill should work. I used [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5368051) as a base (I don't have a Thingiverse account but I feel credit is due anyway; the author is more than welcome to get in touch if this isn't satisfactory)
	- Use the pliers to squeeze in the pins if they don't fit
