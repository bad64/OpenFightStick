## Fightstick case for a normal sized build

---

This case is intended for a decently roomy build.

## Materials needed

- 20 M3 countersunk screws for the case and lever mount, any length between 8 and 12mm should work
- 16 M3 heat-sink inserts
- 4 nuts and washers for mounting the lever
- About 400 grams of whatever filament you decide to print your body with
- About 400 grams of whatever filament you decide to print your plates with
- A mainboard and wires (I use Brook boards)
- 8 30mm arcade buttons (both snap-ins and screw-ins work)
- 3 **screw-in 24mm** arcade buttons for the Options/Share/Home keys
- A low collar lever of your choice, that has Japanese style mounting points (Sanwa JLF/JLX, any Seimitsu with the MS plate, all Sanjuks models, Crown NHM... the list is too long to be exhaustive)
   
## Printing

- Print both with brims (or mouse ears if your slicer can do them; I have not managed to get the plates to stick with mouse ears alone)
- Top & Bottom plates: Tested with PLA and PETG, as long as your filament has good stiffness it should work (this is my way to say "Please don't try TPU or LW-PLA/LW-ASA")
  - 30% grid infill with anywhere between 3 and 5 top/bottom layers. I recommend slicing the plates face down so they take on your build plate's texture
- Body: I recommend PLA; Removing the supports from the options and Neutrik holes from PETG is very hard without power tools or an IDEX system and a roll of PVB. I have *big* doubts about TPU
  - 20% triangular infill
