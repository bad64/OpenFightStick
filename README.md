# Open-source 3D printable fightstick cases for the crafty warrior

Well... yeah that's about all there is to say. Peek the README files inside the folders for more info !

## Tools needed

- A 3D printer, preferably with a build surface at least 300 by 300 millimeters
	- Files for 220 x 220 build plates will be made available if possible
- A screwdriver adapted to whatever screws you pick (Phillips, Pozidriv, Hex... the choice is yours mate, you can even use Torx Security if you ~~feel like a soulless bastard~~ really just don't want anybody to get into your *open-source* controller, I'm not judging ~~I absolutely am judging~~)
- Some fine grit sandpaper, 500 and above (not needed per se but always nice to have in case a hole is too tight)
- A drill, Dremel, or pin vise with appropriate bits, usually 3 and 4mm (ditto)
- A soldering iron
- Lots of M3 heat set inserts
- 5.5mm by 2mm square nuts
- Flush cutters
- A lighter to burn up the angel hair (or y'know just *tune your printer*, that also works)
