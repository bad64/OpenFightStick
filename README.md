# Open-source 3D printable fightstick cases for the crafty warrior

Well... yeah that's about all there is to say. Peek the README files inside the folders for more info !

## Tools needed

- A 3d printer with a build plate at least 220 x 220 x 250mm. These models were essentially made to be printed on a Ender 3 V2 or any clone thereof but I'm sure any modern printer can do it fine.
	- Goblin and Gnome are set up for a 300 x 300 print bed due to their size; it *is* possible to cut them in multiple parts, I just haven't gotten around to it yet
- A screwdriver adapted to whatever screws you pick (Phillips, Pozidriv, Hex... the choice is yours mate, you can even use Torx Security if you want)
- Some fine grit sandpaper (not needed per se but always nice to have in case a hole is too tight)
- A drill or Dremel with a 4mm bit (ditto)
- A soldering iron
- Flush cutters
